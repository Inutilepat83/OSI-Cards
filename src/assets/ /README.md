Place 'MaterialIcons-Regular.woff2' in this folder if you want to use Material Icons locally.

Once the file is in place, the app will pick it up (styles.scss contains a @font-face referencing `assets/fonts/MaterialIcons-Regular.woff2`).

The free Google Material Icons font is subject to the Google Fonts license. If you have permission to self-host it, place the woff2 file here and ensure your app's build includes `src/assets` (default).
