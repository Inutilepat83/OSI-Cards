- [ ] Requirements understood
- [ ] Follows existing pattern
- [ ] Code builds without errors
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Consistency maintained

**Time:** 2-5 minutes

---

## Standard Checklist (Moderate Tasks)

**For moderate tasks (features, refactoring, improvements):**

### Pre-Implementation

- [ ] Requirements fully understood
- [ ] **Stored logs checked from localStorage** (if investigating issue)
  - Library logs: `LoggerService.getLogsFromLocalStorage()`
  - App logs: `LoggingService.getLogsFromLocalStorage()`
- [ ] Root cause identified (if bug)
- [ ] Architecture pattern identified
- [ ] Edge cases considered
- [ ] Testing strategy defined

### Post-Implementation

- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Browser tested (if UI change)
- [ ] Logs checked
- [ ] Consistency verified
- [ ] Documentation updated

**Time:** 10-15 minutes

---

## Comprehensive Checklist (Complex Tasks)

**For complex tasks (architecture changes, major features):**

## ✅ Pre-Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Console messages read (minimal output - full logs in localStorage)
- [ ] Errors identified and fixed (from stored logs)
- [ ] Warnings understood and addressed (from stored logs)
- [ ] Network requests verified
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Logs exported/cleared if needed for deeper analysis

**See:** `.cursor/rules/development/log-analysis.mdc` for detailed logging workflow

### Documentation
- [ ] Code documented
