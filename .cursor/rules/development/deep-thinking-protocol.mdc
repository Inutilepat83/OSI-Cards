# Deep Thinking Protocol

## 🧠 Mandatory Thinking Process

**BEFORE taking any action, ALWAYS follow this process:**

---

## Step 1: Understand the Problem

### Read Full Context

- Read the entire request
- Read relevant code files
- Read related documentation
- Understand the full picture

### Identify Root Cause

- What is the actual problem?
- What are the symptoms?
- What is the underlying issue?
- Why is this happening?

### Consider Implications

- What are the side effects?
- What could break?
- What are the dependencies?
- What are the risks?

### Ask Clarifying Questions

- Is the problem fully understood?
- Are there missing details?
- Are there assumptions?
- What are the constraints?

---

## Step 2: Plan the Solution

### Break Down the Problem

- What are the sub-problems?
- What are the steps needed?
- What is the order of operations?
- What are the dependencies?

### Consider Multiple Approaches

- What are different ways to solve this?
- What are the pros/cons of each?
- What are the trade-offs?
- Which approach is best?

### Evaluate Solutions

- Which is most maintainable?
- Which is most performant?
- Which is most testable?
- Which follows patterns?

### Choose Best Approach

- Select the best solution
- Document the reasoning
- Consider future implications
- Plan for edge cases

---

## Step 3: Implement with Care

### Follow Patterns

- Use existing patterns
- Follow architectural guidelines
- Match code style
- Use established conventions

### Add Error Handling

- Handle expected errors
- Handle unexpected errors
- Provide meaningful messages
- Log errors appropriately

### Consider Performance

- Is this efficient?
- Are there bottlenecks?
- Can this be optimized?
- Is caching needed?

### Document Complex Logic

- Add comments for complex code
- Explain "why" not "what"
- Document decisions
- Add examples if needed

---

## Step 4: Verify Thoroughly

### Test in Browser

- Start the application
- Navigate to feature
- Test functionality
- Check console logs
- Verify visual appearance

### Check Logs

- Read console messages
- Identify errors
- Check warnings
- Verify network requests

### Verify Edge Cases

- Test boundary conditions
- Test empty states
- Test error scenarios
- Test rapid interactions

### Ensure Consistency

- Matches existing code
- Follows patterns
- Uses same conventions
- Consistent with previous work

---

## Step 5: Reflect and Improve

### Review What Worked

- What went well?
- What patterns helped?
- What was effective?

### Identify Improvements

- What could be better?
- What was inefficient?
- What was unclear?

### Document Learnings

- What was learned?
- What patterns emerged?
- What should be remembered?

## 💭 Thinking Prompts

### For Problem Understanding

- "What is the actual problem here?"
- "Why is this happening?"
- "What are all the factors involved?"
- "What am I missing?"

### For Solution Planning

- "What are different ways to solve this?"
- "What are the trade-offs?"
- "Which approach is most maintainable?"
- "What could go wrong?"

### For Implementation

- "Does this follow existing patterns?"
- "Is error handling complete?"
- "Is this performant?"
- "Is this testable?"

### For Verification

- "How will I test this?"
- "What could break?"
- "Are edge cases handled?"
- "Is this consistent?"

---

## 🔄 Iterative Thinking

### Think → Plan → Implement → Verify → Reflect

1. **Think** deeply about the problem
2. **Plan** the solution thoroughly
3. **Implement** with care
4. **Verify** comprehensively
5. **Reflect** and improve

### Don't Skip Steps

- ❌ Don't implement without thinking
- ❌ Don't skip planning
- ❌ Don't skip verification
- ❌ Don't skip reflection

---

## 📊 Quality Indicators

### Good Thinking Shows:

- Clear problem understanding
- Multiple solutions considered
- Reasoning for choices
- Edge cases identified
- Error scenarios planned
- Testing strategy defined

### Poor Thinking Shows:

- Jumping to implementation
- Single solution considered
- No reasoning provided
- Edge cases ignored
- Error handling missing
- No testing plan
