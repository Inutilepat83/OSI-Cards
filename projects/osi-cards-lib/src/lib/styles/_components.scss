/* ===================================================================
   SHARED COMPONENT STYLES BUNDLE
   
   This file contains all component imports shared across all entry points:
   - _styles.scss (demo app, :root scope)
   - _styles-scoped.scss (integration, .osi-cards-container scope)
   - _styles-standalone.scss (full isolation with Bootstrap reset)
   
   Each entry point imports this bundle after setting up its scope and variables.
   
   Note: Using @import here as Sass @use/@forward requires restructuring
   the entire SCSS architecture. These warnings can be safely ignored
   until Dart Sass 3.0.0 when migration will be required.
