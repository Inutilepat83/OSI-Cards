# OSI Cards - Cursor Rules

## CRITICAL: Quality and Consistency

**ALWAYS follow these principles:**

1. **Think Deeply** - Understand root causes, not symptoms
2. **Be Consistent** - Match existing code, patterns, and conventions
3. **Test in Browser** - Always verify in browser for UI changes
4. **Read Logs** - Always check console messages
5. **Implement Tests** - Write tests for all new code
6. **Use Architect MCP** - Always query patterns before generating code

---

## 🧠 Deep Thinking Protocol

**BEFORE any action:**

1. Understand the problem fully
2. Identify root cause
3. Consider multiple solutions
4. Choose best approach with reasoning
5. Plan implementation
6. Plan testing
7. Plan verification

**See:** `.cursor/rules/development/deep-thinking-protocol.mdc`

---

## 🎯 Consistency Rules

**ALWAYS maintain consistency:**

- Code style matches existing
- Patterns match existing
- Naming matches existing
- Error handling matches existing
- Testing matches existing

**See:** `.cursor/rules/development/consistency-enforcement.mdc`

---

## 🌐 Browser Testing (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS test in browser after:**

- Creating/modifying components
- Changing CSS/styling
- Adding new features
- Fixing bugs

**Workflow:**

1. Start app: `npm start`
2. Navigate to feature
3. Test functionality
4. Check console logs
5. Verify visual appearance
6. Test responsive design

**See:** `.cursor/rules/development/browser-testing-workflow.mdc`

---

## 📊 Log Analysis (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS read and analyze:**

- Console errors (must fix)
- Console warnings (should fix)
- Network requests
- Performance metrics
- **Stored logs in localStorage** (ALWAYS CHECK BEFORE DEBUGGING)

**Log Storage Locations:**

- Library logs: `localStorage.getItem('osi-cards-logs')`
- App logs: `localStorage.getItem('osi-cards-app-logs')`
- Access via services: `LoggerService.getLogsFromLocalStorage()` or `LoggingService.getLogsFromLocalStorage()`

**Workflow:**

1. **Check stored logs first** - Read logs from localStorage before debugging
2. Read console messages
3. Categorize issues
4. Fix errors
5. Address warnings
6. Verify fixes

**See:** `.cursor/rules/development/browser-testing-workflow.mdc`

---

## 🧪 Testing Logic

**ALWAYS write tests for:**

- New features
- Bug fixes
- Complex logic
- Edge cases
- Error scenarios

**Test types:**

- Unit tests
- Component tests
- Integration tests
- E2E tests (if applicable)

**See:** `.cursor/rules/development/browser-testing-workflow.mdc`

---

## 🏗️ Architect MCP (MANDATORY)

**Before generating code:**

1. Query patterns: `get_file_design_pattern`
2. Generate following patterns
3. Validate: `review_code_change`
4. Fix violations

**See:** `.cursor/rules/development/architect-mcp-enforcement.mdc`
