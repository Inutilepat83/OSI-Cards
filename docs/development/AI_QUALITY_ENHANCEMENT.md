- Post-implementation checks
- Final verification

**Checklist Areas:**
- Code quality
- Testing
- Browser testing
- Log analysis
- Documentation
- Performance
- Security
- Accessibility

---

## 🔧 Implementation

### How It Works

1. **Cursor Reads Rules**
   - Reads `.cursorrules` file
   - Reads `.cursor/rules/development/*.mdc` files
   - Applies rules to AI behavior

2. **AI Follows Protocols**
   - Deep thinking before action
   - Consistency maintained
   - Browser testing performed
   - Logs analyzed
   - Tests implemented

3. **Quality Verified**
   - Comprehensive QA checklist
   - All checks passed
   - Work marked complete
